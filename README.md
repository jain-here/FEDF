## Week 6: Weather Application

**Aim:** To develop a weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches and displays real-time weather data based on user input, while utilizing localStorage to save the last searched city.

### Features:
- **Weather API Integration**: Uses wttr.in API to fetch real-time weather data
- **Async/Await Implementation**: Modern JavaScript asynchronous programming
- **Local Storage**: Remembers the last searched city for better UX
- **Dynamic DOM Updates**: Real-time weather information display
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid cities and network failures
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and user-friendly interface

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript ES6+ with Fetch API
- Async/Await for asynchronous operations
- LocalStorage API for data persistence

### Files:
- `Week6/index.html`: Main weather application
- `Week6/README.md`: Detailed documentation and VIVA questions

### Key Learning Outcomes:
1. Fetch API usage for HTTP requests
2. Async/await vs Promise chains
3. DOM manipulation and dynamic content updates
4. Browser storage APIs (localStorage)
5. Error handling in asynchronous operations
